# Creators Studio

> **Imagine · Direct · Generate** — Creative Engine for Claude Code

**You shouldn't have to be an AI prompt engineer to make on-brand content.** Most AI image tools hand you a text box and a generic model — you spend more time wrangling prompts than creating, and the output never quite matches your brand voice. Creators Studio flips the script: **Claude becomes your Creative Director**, interpreting your intent, selecting the right domain expertise, and orchestrating the best-in-class AI models for every shot — images, video, audio, and lip-sync — all from inside Claude Code.

Let an AI that's been trained on the best practices for every model write the prompts for you, instead of spending hours teaching yourself to prompt-engineer a moving target.

## The Problem

**Generic AI tools cost you hours and give you work that doesn't look like your brand.** If you've tried producing visual content with AI, you already know the pattern:

- 🎯 **Prompt fatigue** — you spend more time tuning the wording than creating the thing
- 🎨 **Brand drift** — the output looks like "AI art," not your product, your tone, or your aesthetic
- 🔄 **Model lock-in** — you pick a tool, learn its quirks, and a better model ships six weeks later

The AI race is emphatically **not finished**. Kling beat VEO to become the video default. ElevenLabs beat Lyria to become the music default. Fabric opened lip-sync that Kling can't do. The next swap is coming. Anchoring your workflow to any one model will cost you.

## Meet Your Creative Director

Creators Studio installs a **Creative Director skill** into Claude Code. Claude isn't just calling a model API — it's reading your intent, consulting the locked reference guides for every model (*"describe the scene, don't just list keywords"* for Gemini 3.1; character-matching start_image prompts for Kling; audio-duration-calibrated line lengths for ElevenLabs voices), selecting the right provider, constructing the optimized prompt, and orchestrating the result. You describe what you want. Claude figures out how.

**The model-agnostic philosophy is deliberate.** When a new model wins a head-to-head bake-off, it becomes the new default — without you having to relearn the prompting rules. v3.8.0 made Kling v3 the video default after a 94-generation bake-off against VEO. v3.8.3 made ElevenLabs Music the music default after a 12-genre blind A/B test. The underlying `/create-image` and `/create-video` commands don't change. Your brand presets don't change. Your existing workflow doesn't change.

![How It Works](screenshots/pipeline-flow.webp)

## The Plan

Three steps. No prompt engineering required.

| 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|
| **Install the plugin** — one `claude plugin install` command, guided API-key setup | **Describe your intent** — "a product launch hero for wireless earbuds" or "30-second narrated explainer video" | **Claude directs best-in-class AI** — selects domain mode, constructs optimized prompts, orchestrates generation, hands you the result |

## What You Can Make

Three creative surfaces, one Creative Director.

### 📷 Images

**Brand-native visual assets across 87 sizes and ratios on 16 platforms** — broadcast social (Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, TikTok, Pinterest, Threads, Snapchat, Google Ads, Spotify, BlueSky) plus messaging channels for marketing campaigns and automated response engines (Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, ManyChat). Presentations, brand books, and product assets too. Claude reads your intent, picks a domain lens (Cinema, Product, Editorial, UI/Web, Logo, Landscape, etc.), applies your brand style guide if you have one, and generates at the correct aspect ratio and resolution for the target surface — at max-quality upload specs, not platform minimums.

![Asset Registry](screenshots/asset-registry.webp)

![Brand Guide Builder](screenshots/brand-builder.webp)

![Platform-Native Generation](screenshots/social-platforms.webp)

![Deck Builder](screenshots/deck-builder-new.webp)

![A/B Testing](screenshots/ab-testing.webp)

![Content Pipeline](screenshots/content-pipeline.webp)

**Key features:** 5-Input Creative Brief · 11 Domain Modes · 5-Component Prompt Formula · Edit-First refinements · Brand Style Guides · Asset Registry (save once, reuse everywhere) · Platform-native generation (87 sizes × 16 platforms at max-quality specs) · Slide decks and brand books · A/B prompt variation testing · Multi-format output · Session history with gallery export.

### 🎬 Video

**Cinematic sequences with character cohesion, professional audio, and lip-synced narration.** From a one-line idea to a 30-second shipped video: plan the shot list, approve the storyboard frames before burning video budget, generate the clips with the character locked across every shot, and stitch the final with a full audio bed.

![Character Consistency](screenshots/character-consistency.webp)

![Idea to Final](screenshots/video-idea-to-final.webp)

![Video Pipeline](screenshots/video-pipeline.webp)

![Video Domain Modes](screenshots/video-domain-modes.webp)

![Sequence Production](screenshots/sequence-production.webp)

![Storyboard Workflow](screenshots/storyboard-workflow.webp)

**Key features:** Kling v3 Std default (1080p, $0.02/s, 1:1 Instagram-square native) · VEO 3.1 opt-in backup · Character consistency via `start_image` + matched prompt · Multi-shot sequence pipeline (plan → storyboard → generate → stitch) · Mandatory review gate before expensive clip generation · Fabric 1.0 lip-sync (any face + any audio → talking-head MP4) · Image-to-video (animate a still from `/create-image`) · FFmpeg stitch/concat/trim utilities.

### 🎙️ Audio

**Narration, music, and mixed audio beds — designed to replace VEO's emergent audio on stitched sequences.** Custom voice design from plain-English descriptions. Instant Voice Cloning. Multi-provider music with negative-prompt support. Side-chain ducking. End-to-end audio-bed replacement in one command.

![Audio Pipeline](screenshots/audio-pipeline.webp)

**Key features:** ElevenLabs TTS narration (custom voice design + IVC) · ElevenLabs Music (default, won 12-0 blind bake-off vs Lyria) · Lyria 2 alternative ($0.06/clip, negative-prompt support) · Side-chain ducking (music dips under narration automatically) · Auto-measured per-voice WPM for duration-calibrated line lengths · Client-side stripping of copyrighted-creator triggers (so Lyria/Eleven Music don't reject your prompt) · Full audio-bed replacement pipeline for stitched video sequences.

---

**The whole system is the product.** Brand presets feed into images AND video. Asset registry entries appear in both. A custom voice designed once plays in every narrated video. The workflows are deliberately connected.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) installed and working
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed
- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/) installed (for the MCP server)

### Install (recommended — native plugin marketplace)

In any Claude Code session, run:

```
/plugin marketplace add juliandickie/creators-studio
/plugin install creators-studio@creators-studio-marketplace
```

That's it. Claude Code clones the marketplace, fetches the plugin, and registers `/create-image` and `/create-video` immediately. No `git clone`, no `--plugin-dir`, no `/reload-plugins` dance.

<details>
<summary><b>Alternative: clone for local development</b></summary>

If you want to hack on the plugin itself rather than just use it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juliandickie/creators-studio.git ~/creators-studio
claude --plugin-dir ~/creators-studio
```

Use `/reload-plugins` after edits to pick up changes without restarting.

</details>

### Configure your Google AI API key

Get a free key at [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey), then in Claude Code:

```
/create-image setup
```

Claude walks you through the key setup conversationally. Your key is saved to `~/.claude/settings.json` (for the MCP server) and `~/.banana/config.json` (for fallback scripts). Keys never leave your machine and are never sent to GitHub.

> **Free tier:** ~5-15 images per minute, ~20-500 per day. No credit card required.
>
> **Video generation (paid):** Kling v3 Std at $0.02/s via Replicate ($0.16 per 8s clip). VEO 3.1 opt-in backup requires Google Cloud billing.

### Test it

```
/create-image generate "a golden banana wearing a beret"
```

If you see an image path and the file exists, you're all set.

### Updating

```
/plugin marketplace update creators-studio-marketplace
/plugin update creators-studio
```

The first command refreshes the marketplace catalog from GitHub; the second pulls down any new plugin version. If you installed via the local-clone alternative above, run `cd ~/creators-studio && git pull` instead, then `/reload-plugins`.

<details>
<summary><b>🔧 Optional: Replicate as fallback backend</b></summary>

Replicate provides an alternative API backend using `google/nano-banana-2` for images and is the required backend for Kling v3 video and Fabric 1.0 lip-sync. Useful when the MCP server isn't available, or if you prefer simpler auth.

1. Get a token at [replicate.com/account/api-tokens](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens)
2. In Claude Code: `/create-image setup replicate`
3. Paste the token when prompted

The image fallback chain is automatic: MCP → Direct Gemini API → Replicate. Video always uses Replicate for Kling/Fabric.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🎬 Optional: VEO 3.1 video (Vertex AI, paid)</b></summary>

VEO is the opt-in backup for video. For full VEO capabilities (Lite at $0.05/s, image-to-video, Scene Extension v2, GA `-001` IDs) you need a Vertex AI API key. Add three fields to `~/.banana/config.json`:

```json
{
  "vertex_api_key": "...",
  "vertex_project_id": "my-project-123",
  "vertex_location": "us-central1"
}
```

Invoke via `/create-video generate "..." --provider veo --tier {lite|fast|standard}`.

</details>

## How It Works

Every generation follows the same Creative Director pipeline:

1. **Intent** — Claude reads your request and gathers the 5-Input Creative Brief (Purpose, Audience, Subject, Brand, References)
2. **Domain** — Claude selects the right creative lens (Cinema, Product, Portrait, Editorial, UI/Web, Logo, Landscape, Abstract, Infographic, Presentation)
3. **Prompt** — Claude constructs the prompt using the model's native strengths (Gemini 3.1's narrative understanding, Kling's multi_prompt shot list, ElevenLabs' audio-tag vocabulary)
4. **Generate** — Claude calls the best-in-class model for the task with the optimized parameters
5. **Deliver** — Save the asset, log the cost, offer refinement suggestions

Every reference guide (`references/prompt-engineering.md`, `references/kling-models.md`, `references/audio-pipeline.md`, etc.) is loaded on demand — Claude only reads what's relevant to the current task. The references are revised against the official model docs every time a new model version ships; that's the "AI writes for AI" loop in practice.

## The 5-Component Prompt Formula

![Prompt Formula](screenshots/reasoning-brief.webp)

Instead of sending "a cat in space" to the API, Claude constructs:

> A medium shot of a tabby cat floating weightlessly inside the cupola module of the International Space Station, paws outstretched toward a floating droplet of water, Earth visible through the circular windows behind. Soft directional light from the windows illuminates the cat's fur with a blue-white rim light, while the interior has warm amber instrument panel glow. Captured with a Canon EOS R5, 35mm f/2.0 lens, slight barrel distortion emphasizing the curved module interior. Sharp documentary clarity.

**Components used:** Subject (tabby cat, physical detail) → Action (floating, paw gesture) → Location/Context (ISS cupola, Earth visible) → Composition (medium shot, curved framing) → Style (Canon R5, directional window light + amber instruments)

## Domain Modes

![Domain Modes](screenshots/domain-modes.webp)

| Mode | Best For | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| **Cinema** | Dramatic, storytelling | "A noir detective scene in a rain-soaked alley" |
| **Product** | E-commerce, packshots | "Photograph my handmade candle for Etsy" |
| **Portrait** | People, characters | "A cyberpunk character portrait for my game" |
| **Editorial** | Fashion, lifestyle | "A fashion shot for my brand's lookbook" |
| **UI/Web** | Icons, illustrations | "A set of onboarding illustrations" |
| **Logo** | Branding, identity | "A minimalist logo for a tech startup" |
| **Landscape** | Backgrounds, wallpapers | "A misty mountain sunrise for my desktop" |
| **Infographic** | Data, diagrams | "Visualize our Q1 sales growth" |
| **Abstract** | Generative art, textures | "Voronoi tessellation in neon gradients" |
| **Presentation (Complete)** | Finished slides with text | "Title slide with 'DIGITAL INNOVATION' headline" |
| **Presentation (Background)** | Slide backgrounds for layering | "Dark premium background for keynote deck" |

## Models

Creators Studio is model-agnostic — models are swapped in and out based on empirical bake-offs, not brand loyalty. The current roster reflects tried-and-tested winners as of v4.0.0.

| Surface | Default | Alternative | Specialist |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Image** | Gemini 3.1 Flash (free tier) | Gemini 2.5 Flash · Replicate `google/nano-banana-2` | — |
| **Video** | Kling v3 Std ($0.02/s, 1080p) | VEO 3.1 Lite/Fast/Standard (opt-in, `--provider veo`) | DreamActor M2.0 (deferred to v4.1.x) |
| **Music** | ElevenLabs Music (won 12-0 bake-off) | Lyria 2 ($0.06/clip, supports negative-prompt) | — |
| **Voice/TTS** | ElevenLabs (custom design + cloning) | — | — |
| **Lip-sync** | — | — | VEED Fabric 1.0 ($0.15/s output, 720p max) |

## What Makes This Different

- **5-Input Creative Brief** — Gathers Purpose, Audience, Subject, Brand, References before generating
- **Domain Expertise** — Selects the right creative lens per the 11 modes above
- **5-Component Prompt Formula** — Subject + Action + Location + Composition + Style
- **Start with Intent, Refine with Specs** — Two-phase prompting with the PEEL strategy (Position, Expression, Environment, Lens)
- **Edit-First Workflow** — 90% of refinements edit the image rather than regenerating
- **Brand Style Guides** — Rich preset system with background styles, motifs, keywords, do's/don'ts, and prompt suffixes
- **Asset Registry** — Save characters, products, equipment, environments once; reuse forever across sessions
- **Presentation Mode** — Complete slides with rendered text, or clean backgrounds for layering
- **Multi-Provider Fallback** — MCP → Direct Gemini API → Replicate for maximum availability
- **Session Consistency** — Character/style maintained across multi-turn chat with progressive enhancement
- **4K Output · 14 Aspect Ratios** — Including ultra-wide 21:9 and extreme 8:1 banners

## Release History

<details>
<summary><b>🎵 v4.2.1 (current) — Vertex Retirement + Lyria 3 Upgrade · 2026-04-24</b></summary>

Sub-project B of the provider-agnostic roadmap. Deleted `_vertex_backend.py` (958 lines). VEO 3.1 (all three tiers) and Lyria family now route through Replicate. Lyria upgraded from Lyria 2 → Lyria 3 Clip as within-Lyria default (30% cheaper, new image-input capability). Lyria 2 still available for `negative_prompt` via `--lyria-version 2`. Lyria 3 Pro registered for full-song generation with structure tags, auto-selected when prompt contains `[Verse]`/`[Chorus]`/timestamp markers (gated by `--confirm-upgrade` to prevent 2x cost surprises). Bonus: Kling v3 pricing corrected — VEO Lite turns out to be ~4× cheaper than Kling at 1080p with audio, inverting the v3.8.0 cost narrative.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🔌 v4.2.0 — Provider-Agnostic Architecture · 2026-04-23</b></summary>

The plugin is now marketplace-neutral. Bring your own API key for Replicate today; the architecture is ready for Kie.ai, Hugging Face Inference Providers, fal.ai, or any future marketplace to ship as a **one-file addition**. New `scripts/backends/` abstraction, canonical task schema, model registry, and two-stage routing — all tested (74 tests) with zero behavior change for existing commands. Python floor lifted 3.6 → 3.12.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>📜 v4.0.0 — Rebrand to Creators Studio · 2026-04-17</b></summary>

Full rebrand from `nano-banana-studio` to **Creators Studio** — *Imagine · Direct · Generate. Creative Engine for Claude Code.* The old name anchored the plugin to a single Google model at a moment when Kling, ElevenLabs Music, and Fabric had already become best-in-class for their respective surfaces; the new identity is model-agnostic so future swaps don't require a rebrand. Commands change to `/create-image` and `/create-video`. Your `~/.banana/` config, API keys, custom voices, and presets carry forward unchanged — zero config loss on upgrade.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>📦 v3.8.4 — Replicate Cost Tracking + Strip-List Config · 2026-04-16</b></summary>

Replicate video costs now land in your cost ledger. Kling ($0.02/s), DreamActor ($0.05/s), and Fabric ($0.15/s) pricing is registered in `cost_tracker.py`, and every successful `/create-video generate` or `/create-video lipsync` run auto-logs. Also: extend the named-creator strip-list via `named_creator_triggers` in `~/.banana/config.json`, and wrapper phrases (*"in the style of"*, *"inspired by"*) are cleaned up after the creator name is removed.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🎵 v3.8.3 — ElevenLabs Music as Default Provider · 2026-04-16</b></summary>

A 12-genre blind A/B bake-off found ElevenLabs Music decisively outperforms Lyria 2 across every genre tested. ElevenLabs is now the default `--music-source`; Lyria remains available via `--music-source lyria` for its unique `negative_prompt` feature.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🎬 v3.8.2 — Character Consistency via start_image · 2026-04-16</b></summary>

Kling's `start_image` feature serves as a character identity lock for multi-clip brand work: generate a reference image once, then pass it as `--first-frame` on every Kling call with a character-matching prompt — and the character persists across separate generations at full 1080p. DreamActor M2.0 deferred to v4.1.x for real-footage-to-avatar workflows.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🎤 v3.8.1 — Fabric Lip-Sync + Defensive Hardening · 2026-04-15</b></summary>

New `/create-video lipsync` command pairs any face image with any audio file (including custom-designed ElevenLabs voices from `/create-video audio narrate`) via VEED Fabric 1.0. Also includes Cloudflare User-Agent hardening on the image-gen Replicate path, `_vertex_backend smoke-test` subcommand, and the Seedance 2.0 retest verdict: **permanently rejected** (E005 filter triggers on every human subject tested).

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🎥 v3.8.0 — Kling v3 as Default Video Model · 2026-04-15</b></summary>

v3.8.0 switches the default video model from VEO 3.1 to Kling v3 Std (via Replicate) after a 15-shot-type head-to-head bake-off. Kling wins 8 of 15 playback-verified shot types (VEO 0), is 7.5× cheaper per 8s clip, natively supports 1:1 Instagram-square aspect ratio, and produces coherent 30-second narratives where VEO's extended workflow produces glitches. VEO remains available as an opt-in backup via `--provider veo`.

<summary><b>📚 Older releases (v1.4.2 → v3.7.4)</b></summary>

### Audio & Video era (v3.x)

**v3.7.4** — Audio polish bundle: real stereo narration mix, Instant Voice Cloning, auto-measured per-voice WPM, multi-call Lyria with FFmpeg crossfade, shared client-side creator stripping across Lyria + ElevenLabs Music.

**v3.7.3** — Prompt-engineering reference refreshed against Google's official Gemini 3.1 Flash Image guide. Leads with *"describe the scene, don't just list keywords"*.

**v3.7.2** — Google Lyria 2 made the (then-)default music source after 5-way bake-off (Lyria > ElevenLabs > MusicGen > MiniMax > Stable Audio). Script renamed `elevenlabs_audio.py` → `audio_pipeline.py`.

**v3.7.1** — ElevenLabs Audio Replacement Pipeline + Custom Voice Design. One command replaces the entire audio bed on stitched VEO sequences. Design a voice from plain-English description, save under a semantic role name.

**v3.6.3** — Review Gate Enforcement + Smarter Plans. Mandatory review gate before any video generation call, catching the expensive failure mode of generating a $12 clip against a silently-regenerated frame.

**v3.6.2** — Sequence Production Polish from the first real shoot: review subcommand, `use_veo_interpolation` per-shot flag, partial storyboard regeneration via `--shots 1,3-5`.

**v3.6.1** — First+last frame interpolation + reference images on Vertex.

**v3.6.0** — Vertex AI Backend. A new backend using bound-to-service-account API-key auth (no OAuth, no service account JSON, no `gcloud`) unlocks VEO 3.1 Lite at $0.05/sec, image-to-video via `--first-frame`, Scene Extension v2, and GA `-001` model IDs.

**v3.5.0** — VEO 3.1 Model Variants & Draft Workflow. Lite/Fast/Standard tiers, `--quality-tier` flag, model routing infrastructure, corrected VEO pricing.

**v3.4.x → v3.0.0** — Video skill launch: VEO 3.1 text-to-video, image-to-video, first/last frame, multi-shot sequences, extension + stitching toolkit, domain modes + audio prompting, cross-skill integration with image generation.

### Image expansion era (v2.x)

**v2.7.0** — Multi-Modal Content Pipeline. Single idea → hero image + social pack + email header + format pack + video clip.

**v2.0.0** — Visual Brand Book Generator (markdown + pptx + html).

**v1.9.0** — Reverse Prompt Engineering.

**v1.8.0** — Asset Registry — persistent characters/products/objects.
