# Nano Banana Studio: Expansion Roadmap

## Context

Nano Banana Studio v3.3.0 is a comprehensive Creative Director plugin for AI image generation. This roadmap captures planned features, organized by implementation priority.

**Architecture note:** As this grows, the skill should split into three interlinked skills:
1. **Brand Learning** (`/banana brand`) — Brand guide creation, asset registry, presets
2. **Image Generation** (`/banana`, `/banana generate`, `/banana slides`, `/banana social`) — The current core, images only
3. **Video Generation** (`/banana video`) — VEO 3.1 integration, separate skill with shared brand/asset system

These would share the brand preset system and asset registry but have their own domain modes, prompt engineering, and output pipelines.

## Next Up

### `/banana video` — Video Generation with VEO 3.1

VEO 3.1 (`veo-3.1-generate-preview`) is live and uses the same Google AI API key.

- Text-to-video and image-to-video (animate a generated image)
- 4-8 second clips at 24fps, up to 4K resolution
- Built-in audio generation (dialogue, sound effects, ambient)
- 16:9 and 9:16, reference images (up to 3), video extension (up to 141s)

**Should be a separate skill** that shares brand presets and asset registry with the image generation skill.

```
/banana video "product reveal of the iTero Scanner rotating on dark surface"
/banana video --from ~/slides/slide-03.png "animate the dental arch models"
```

Implementation: `video_generate.py` (stdlib-only, same pattern), `/banana video` skill file.

## Priority Summary

| # | Feature | Effort | Impact | Status |
|---|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| 1 | `/video` sequence production (storyboard, multi-shot) | Medium | Very High | Next |
| 2 | `/video extend` + `/video stitch` | Low | Medium | Planned |
