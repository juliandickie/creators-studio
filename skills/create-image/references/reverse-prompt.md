# Reverse Prompt Engineering Reference

## Overview

Reverse prompt engineering takes an existing image and decomposes it into a
structured prompt using the 5-Component Formula. This teaches prompt engineering
by example and enables style recreation across multiple generations.

## How to Analyze an Image

When the user provides an image (file path or upload), analyze it systematically:

### Step 1: Identify the Domain Mode

Look at the image and determine which domain mode best describes it:
Cinema, Product, Portrait, Editorial, UI/Web, Logo, Landscape, Abstract,
Infographic, or Presentation.

### Step 2: Decompose Using the 5-Component Formula

Extract each component from what you observe:

| Component | What to Extract | Weight |
|-----------|----------------|--------|
| **Subject** (30%) | Who/what is the primary focus? Age, appearance, material, species, physical details. | Most important - be specific |
| **Action** (10%) | What is the subject doing? Pose, gesture, movement, state. | Use present-tense verbs |
| **Location** (15%) | Where is the scene? Time of day, weather, atmosphere, environmental details. | Include mood-setting details |
| **Composition** (10%) | Camera perspective, framing, angle, focal length, depth of field. | Estimate the lens and f-stop |
| **Style** (25%) | Visual register, medium, lighting setup, color grading. | Describe the register directly; do NOT name a publication |

### Step 3: Identify Technical Details

- **Camera/lens estimate:** "Looks like an 85mm f/1.4 based on the depth of field and compression"
- **Lighting setup:** "Key light from upper-left, soft fill from right, rim light behind"
- **Color grading:** "Warm tones, slightly desaturated, lifted shadows"
- **Aspect ratio:** Measure or estimate (16:9, 4:5, 1:1, etc.)

### Step 4: Construct the Prompt

Write the prompt as natural narrative prose following the 5-Component Formula.
Describe the visual register directly (lighting, lens, composition, colour
grading). Do NOT name a publication ("Vanity Fair editorial," "National
Geographic cover") -- Gemini renders a literal magazine cover with masthead and
gibberish headlines instead of the image you want.

Apply the same rules as regular prompt construction:
- Cut useless quality keywords ("8K", "masterpiece", "ultra-realistic") -- noise on Gemini 3.1; do NOT swap in publication names
- Use specific camera names and lens specs
- Include micro-details (textures, reflections, atmospheric elements)
- Describe what you SEE, not what it MEANS

## Output Format

Present the analysis with THREE perspectives - how Claude sees it, how Gemini sees it, and a blended best-of-both version. This teaches users how different AI models interpret the same image and how to write better descriptions.

### Step 5: Get Gemini's Perspective

Send the image to Gemini via `gemini_chat` with this prompt:
"Describe this image in precise detail as if writing a prompt to recreate it. Include: subject appearance, action/pose, setting/location, camera angle and framing, lighting setup, color grading, and overall style. Be specific about materials, textures, and atmosphere."

### Step 6: Compare and Blend

Compare Claude's analysis (Steps 2-3) with Gemini's response (Step 5) and create a blended version that takes the best details from each.

## Output Format

```
## Reverse Prompt Analysis

**Domain Mode:** [mode]
**Estimated Aspect Ratio:** [ratio]

### 5-Component Breakdown

| Component | Extracted |
|-----------|----------|
| **Subject** | [detailed description] |
| **Action** | [pose/state] |
| **Location** | [setting/context] |
| **Composition** | [camera/framing] |
| **Style** | [lighting/aesthetic/anchor] |

### Claude's Interpretation

[Claude's full prompt - how Claude describes the image using the 5-Component
Formula. Tends to be more structured and technically precise about camera
specs, composition terminology, and direct visual-register description.]

### Gemini's Interpretation

[Gemini's description - how Gemini naturally describes the same image.
Tends to be more atmospheric and may notice different details, textures,
or emotional qualities that Claude's structured approach misses.]

### Blended Prompt (Best of Both)

[A merged version that combines Claude's technical precision with Gemini's
atmospheric detail. This is the recommended prompt to use for recreation.
It should be a single narrative paragraph, ready to copy.]

### What You Can Learn From the Comparison

[2-3 bullet points highlighting interesting differences:
- "Claude focused on [X] while Gemini noticed [Y]"
- "The blended version adds [Z] which neither caught alone"
- "For this type of image, [specific technique] makes the biggest difference"]

### Settings

- **Aspect ratio:** [ratio]
- **Resolution:** [recommendation]
- **Model:** gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview
- **Domain mode:** [mode]

## Tips

- **Be more specific than the original** - the model needs detail to recreate,
  even if the original was generated from a simpler prompt
- **Estimate camera specs confidently** - "Shot on Canon EOS R5, 85mm f/1.4"
  gives the model concrete depth-of-field information even if you're guessing
- **Describe the visual register directly** -- "high-contrast studio portrait,
  single hard key light" beats naming a publication, which renders a literal
  cover with masthead text
- **For illustrated/stylized images** - describe the art style, line weight,
  color palette, and shading technique rather than camera specs
- **The reconstructed prompt should be longer than the original** - good
  reverse engineering adds detail the original prompt may have omitted
