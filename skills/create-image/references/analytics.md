## Dashboard Sections

## Data Sources

The dashboard aggregates from three existing data files (no new logging needed):
- `~/.creators-studio/costs.json` — created by cost_tracker.py
- `~/.creators-studio/history/*.json` — created by history.py
- `~/.creators-studio/ab_preferences.json` — created by abtester.py

## Time Range

Default: last 30 days. Adjust with `--days N`. The dashboard shows data within the specified period only.

## Output

The HTML dashboard is self-contained — no external JavaScript or CSS dependencies. Opens in any browser. Can be printed to PDF.
