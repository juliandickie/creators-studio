# Video Sequence Production Reference

## Overview

VEO generates max 8 seconds per clip. Longer productions require a **shot list** approach: break the script into individual shots, generate storyboard frame pairs for approval, then batch-generate video clips and stitch them together.

This Gemini + VEO workflow (Gemini for still storyboard frames → VEO for
clip interpolation) is Google's officially recommended pattern for
multi-shot production, not just our opinion. It both lets you catch
composition problems at image cost before committing to video cost, and
locks in per-shot continuity via first/last frame keyframing.

## Draft-then-Final Workflow (v3.6.0+)

```
Plan → Storyboard → Generate (draft) → Review → Generate (final) → Stitch
```

With three VEO tiers reachable through the v3.6.0 Vertex AI backend
(Lite, Fast, Standard), the cheapest validated path is to run the whole
sequence at **Lite draft** quality first, review the motion and
continuity, then re-run the approved shots at **Standard** for delivery.

```bash
# 1. First pass: draft at Lite ($0.05/sec, 8× cheaper than Standard)
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/video_sequence.py generate \
    --storyboard ~/storyboard --quality-tier draft

# 2. Review the MP4s. Approve, tweak prompts, or regenerate.

# 3. Final pass: Standard for delivery
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/video_sequence.py generate \
    --storyboard ~/storyboard --quality-tier standard
```

`--quality-tier draft` maps to `veo-3.1-lite-generate-001` (the alias
`--quality-tier lite` is also accepted). The Vertex AI backend
auto-routes Lite — no extra flag needed if you have Vertex credentials
in `~/.banana/config.json` (see `veo-models.md` → Backend Availability
for the 3-minute setup).

### Cost Comparison (4 shots × 8 s, 30-second sequence)

| Mode | Draft pass | Final pass | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Blind at Standard | — | $12.80 | $12.80 |
| Blind at Fast | — | $4.80 | $4.80 |
| Blind at Lite | — | $1.60 | $1.60 |
| **Lite draft + Fast final** | **$1.60** | **$4.80** | **$6.40** |
| **Lite draft + Standard final** | **$1.60** | **$12.80** | **$14.40** |

A Lite draft pass adds **just $1.60** to a $12.80 Standard final. In
practice, blind generation at Standard typically needs 1–2 regenerations
per shot because the user cannot preview motion before committing. One
regeneration of a single 8 s Standard shot ($3.20) already exceeds the
$1.60 draft-pass protection. **Draft-then-final pays for itself the
first time it prevents a regeneration on any shot at Standard tier** —
and it usually prevents several.

## Timestamp Prompting: Pack Multiple Shots per Clip

VEO 3.1 supports a timestamp syntax within a single prompt that directs
multi-shot sequences inside one 8-second generation. A 30-second sequence
that would otherwise need 4 clips can sometimes be compressed to 2
clips with 4 sub-shots each, cutting VEO cost by ~50%. See the
timestamp-prompting section in `video-prompt-engineering.md` for syntax
and caveats.

## Character Drift Mitigation

VEO treats each prompt as a fresh generation with no persistent
character memory. Between clips, faces, clothing, and hairstyle can
subtly or dramatically shift. The consistency rules below (identity
lock, wardrobe lock, reference images) are **mitigations, not
solutions** — see the Known Limitations section of `veo-models.md`.

## The 4-Stage Pipeline

### Stage 1: Shot List (Free)

Claude breaks the user's script/concept into individual shots:
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/video_sequence.py plan --script "30-second product launch ad" --target 30
```

Each shot specifies: number, duration, camera, subject, action, setting, audio, consistency anchors, and prompts for start/end frame generation.

### Stage 2: Storyboard (Cheap — image cost only)

Generate start/end frame image pairs for visual approval:
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/video_sequence.py storyboard --plan shot-list.json
```

Uses `/banana`'s `generate.py` (cross-skill) to produce still frames at ~$0.08 each. User reviews the visual storyboard and approves or requests changes before committing to video.

**Cost:** N shots x 2 frames x $0.078 = ~$0.80 for 5 shots

### Stage 3: Video Generation (Expensive — VEO cost)

Generate video clips from approved storyboard frames:
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/video_sequence.py generate --storyboard ~/storyboard/
```

Each shot uses its start frame as `--first-frame` and end frame as `--last-frame` for VEO, ensuring frame-perfect continuity between shots.

**Cost:** N shots x $1.20 = ~$6.00 for 5 shots

### Stage 4: Assembly

Concatenate clips into final sequence:
```bash
python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/video_sequence.py stitch --clips ~/clips/ --output final.mp4
```

## First/Last Frame Chaining

The key to seamless sequences: the end frame of shot N becomes the start frame of shot N+1.

```
Shot 1: start_A → (VEO) → clip ending at frame B
Shot 2: frame B → (VEO) → clip ending at frame C
Shot 3: frame C → (VEO) → clip ending at frame D
```

The storyboard stage generates these frame pairs using Gemini image generation (cheap), then the video stage interpolates motion between them (expensive but guided).

## Target Durations

| Target | Shots | Structure | Est. Cost |
|--------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **15s** | 2-3 | Establish → Action → Close | $3-5 |
| **30s** | 4-5 | Establish → Problem → Solution → Product → CTA | $6-9 |
| **60s** | 8-10 | Full narrative arc with B-roll | $12-16 |
| **90s** | 12-15 | Tutorial with cutaways | $18-24 |

Costs include storyboard frames + video clips. Actual cost depends on resolution and model tier.

## Consistency Rules

1. **Identity lock** — Repeat character descriptions verbatim in every shot prompt
2. **Wardrobe lock** — Never vary clothing between shots
3. **Lighting lock** — Same lighting setup described in every prompt
4. **Setting lock** — Identical environment description when shots share a location
5. **Grade lock** — Same color grade (e.g., "teal-and-magenta") in every prompt
6. **Reference images** — Use asset registry references in every shot (up to 3)
