# CLAUDE.md -- Development context for nano-banana-studio

This file is read by Claude Code when working inside this repository.

**Start every session by reading `PROGRESS.md`** -- it has full development
history, design decisions, and next steps.

## What this repo is

`nano-banana-studio` is a Claude Code **plugin** that enables AI image generation
using Google's Gemini Nano Banana models via MCP. Claude acts as a Creative
Director: it interprets intent, selects domain expertise, constructs
optimized prompts, and orchestrates Gemini API calls.

## Plugin structure

This repo follows the official Claude Code plugin layout:
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` -- Plugin manifest
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` -- Marketplace catalog for distribution
- `skills/banana/` -- The main skill (SKILL.md + references + scripts)
- `agents/` -- Subagents (brief-constructor)

## Model status (as of March 2026)

- `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` -- **Active default.** Nano Banana 2.
- `gemini-2.5-flash-image` -- **Active.** Nano Banana original. Budget/free tier.
- `gemini-3-pro-image-preview` -- **DEAD.** Shut down March 9, 2026. Do not use.

## How to test changes

1. Test as plugin: `claude --plugin-dir .`
2. Or install standalone: `bash install.sh`
3. Test basic generation: `/banana generate "a red apple on a white table"`
4. Test domain routing: `/banana generate "product shot for headphones"`
5. Test editing: `/banana edit [path] "make the background blurry"`
6. Verify output image files exist at the logged path
7. Check cost log if cost_tracker.py is active

## Scripts use stdlib only

All fallback scripts (`generate.py`, `edit.py`, `replicate_generate.py`, `replicate_edit.py`)
use Python's `urllib.request` to call APIs directly. They have ZERO pip dependencies by design.
Do NOT add `google-genai`, `requests`, or `replicate` as dependencies -- the stdlib approach
ensures the skill works on any system with Python 3.6+.

## Key constraints

- `imageSize` parameter values must be UPPERCASE: "1K", "2K", "4K". Lowercase fails silently.
- Gemini generates ONE image per API call. There is no batch parameter.
- No negative prompt parameter exists. Use semantic reframing in the prompt.
- `responseModalities` must explicitly include "IMAGE" or the API returns text only.
- NEVER use banned keywords in prompts: "8K", "masterpiece", "ultra-realistic", "high resolution" -- these degrade output quality. Use prestigious context anchors instead (see prompt-engineering.md).
- NEVER mention "logo" in Presentation mode prompts -- the model generates unwanted logo artifacts. Describe the area as "clean negative space" instead. Logos are composited in presentation software.
- Brand Style Guide fields in presets are optional -- old presets without them continue to work.
- Fallback chain: MCP (primary) -> Direct Gemini API -> Replicate.

## Upstream tracking

Originally forked from https://github.com/AgriciDaniel/banana-claude (v1.4.1 baseline), now an independent project.

To check for upstream changes:
```bash
git fetch upstream
git diff upstream/main
```

Our additions over upstream: Replicate backend, Presentation mode, Brand Style Guides,
research-driven prompt improvements (5-Input Creative Brief, PEEL strategy, Edit-First,
Progressive Enhancement, expanded character consistency, multilingual support).

## Installation

Test locally: `claude --plugin-dir .` or standalone: `bash install.sh`

## Feature Completion Checklist

**MANDATORY: After completing ANY feature or significant change, run through this
entire checklist before committing.** Do not skip items. Do not batch them for later.

### 1. Version Bump (ALL 3 files)

| File | What to update |
|------|---------------|
| `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | `"version"` field |
| `README.md` | Version badge number in shields.io URL |
| `CITATION.cff` | `version` field + `date-released` to today |

Do NOT set version in `marketplace.json` -- it conflicts with `plugin.json`.
SKILL.md no longer carries version -- `plugin.json` is the authoritative source.

### 2. Documentation Updates

| File | What to update |
|------|---------------|
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Add new `## [X.Y.Z]` section with Added/Changed/Fixed. Add link reference at bottom. |
| `README.md` | Update "What's New in This Fork" section if feature is user-facing. Update architecture diagram if new files created. Update commands table if new commands added. |
| `PROGRESS.md` | Add session entry with numbered list of what was done. Update priority table if roadmap item completed. Update version in header. |
| `ROADMAP.md` | Mark completed features. Update version reference. |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Update file responsibilities table if new files created. Update key constraints if new rules added. |

### 3. README "What's New in This Fork" Check (IMPORTANT — frequently missed)

If the feature is user-facing, it MUST appear in the README "What's New in This Fork" section.
Each feature gets a `### Feature Name (vX.Y.Z)` heading with a brief description.
Check: does the new feature have its own subsection in "What's New"? If not, add it.

### 4. Command Sync Check (IMPORTANT — frequently missed)

Every command in SKILL.md Quick Reference table MUST also appear in:
- **README.md Commands table** — exact same commands and descriptions
- **README.md Quick Start section** — include examples for major new commands

Run this to verify:
```bash
echo "=== SKILL.md ===" && grep '| `/banana' skills/banana/SKILL.md
echo "=== README ===" && grep '| `/banana' README.md
```
If they don't match, update README before committing.

### 5. README Architecture Diagram Check (IMPORTANT — frequently missed)

If ANY new files were created (scripts, references, presets, etc.), the architecture
tree diagram in README.md MUST be updated to include them. Also verify the version
number and SKILL.md line count in the diagram are current.

Run this to compare:
```bash
echo "=== Diagram files ===" && grep '│' README.md | grep -oE '[a-z_-]+\.(md|py|json)' | sort
echo "=== Actual files ===" && (ls skills/banana/references/ skills/banana/scripts/) | sort
```
If the lists don't match, update the diagram.

### 6. Cross-File Consistency Check (versions, models, ratios)

After all edits, verify these match across files:
- **Version number** identical in all 3 version files (plugin.json, README.md badge, CITATION.cff)
- **File list** in CLAUDE.md file responsibilities table matches what exists on disk
- **Model names** and **rate limits** consistent across gemini-models.md, cost-tracking.md, mcp-tools.md
- **Aspect ratios** consistent across gemini-models.md, replicate.md, generate.py, replicate_generate.py

### 7. New Script Checks

If any new Python scripts were created:
- `chmod +x` — all scripts in `scripts/` must be executable
- Verify they compile: `python3 -c "import py_compile; py_compile.compile('path', doraise=True)"`
- Test `--help` works

### 8. SKILL.md Size Check

```bash
wc -l skills/banana/SKILL.md  # Must stay under 500 lines
```

Current: ~200 lines (lean orchestrator pattern). If approaching 300+, extract to reference files.

### 9. Memory File

Update `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/project_banana_claude_workflow.md` if:
- Version changed
- New key constraints added
- Architecture changed (e.g., new skill files, new reference files)

### 10. Git Commit

Stage specific files (not `git add -A`). Commit with descriptive message following the pattern:
- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation only
- `refactor:` for restructuring

Push to fork: `git push origin main`

### 11. GitHub Release + Distribution Zips (on version bumps)

When a version is bumped, create a GitHub Release with distribution zips:

```bash
# Build plugin zip (excludes .git, screenshots, dev files, .claude/)
cd /path/to/nano-banana-studio
zip -r ../nano-banana-studio-vX.Y.Z.zip . -x ".git/*" ".DS_Store" "*/.DS_Store" \
  "*__pycache__/*" "*.pyc" ".github/*" "screenshots/*" "PROGRESS.md" \
  "ROADMAP.md" "CODEOWNERS" "CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md" "SECURITY.md" \
  "CITATION.cff" ".gitattributes" ".gitignore" ".claude/*"

# Build skill zip (standalone, no plugin wrapper)
mkdir -p /tmp/banana-skill/banana
cp -r skills/banana/* /tmp/banana-skill/banana/
cp agents/brief-constructor.md /tmp/banana-skill/banana/
cd /tmp/banana-skill && zip -r /path/to/banana-skill-vX.Y.Z.zip banana/
rm -rf /tmp/banana-skill

# Create GitHub Release with zips attached
gh release create vX.Y.Z \
  ../nano-banana-studio-vX.Y.Z.zip \
  ../banana-skill-vX.Y.Z.zip \
  --title "vX.Y.Z" \
  --notes "See CHANGELOG.md for details"
```

## Plugin development notes

- `.claude-plugin/` contains ONLY `plugin.json` and `marketplace.json`. Never put skills, agents, or commands in this directory.
- `skills/` and `agents/` must be at plugin root (not inside `.claude-plugin/`).
- Plugin variable `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` resolves to the plugin cache directory. Use for hook commands and MCP configs.
- SKILL.md uses `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` for script paths -- this is a semantic marker Claude interprets based on context. Works in both plugin and standalone mode.
- Relative paths in SKILL.md (`references/`, `scripts/`) resolve relative to SKILL.md location. These work in both modes.
- Test locally with `claude --plugin-dir .` (loads plugin without installing).
- After changes, run `/reload-plugins` in Claude Code to pick up updates without restarting.
- Validate with `claude plugin validate .` or `/plugin validate .` before releasing.
